Step 1: Clarify the requirements(core: narrow down requirements)
    1. 服务需求
        functional requirement
        1. upload(主要)
        2. view(主要)
        3. share
        4. like/dislike
        5. comment
        6. search
        7. recommend
        non-functional requirement
        1. Consistency
        1) Every read receives the most recent write or an error
o Tradeoff with Availability: Eventual consistency Availability
        2) Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
        2. Scalable
        1. Performance: low Latency
Partition tolerance (Fault Tolerance)
P
The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being
dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes
    2. 流量大小, traffic/user size
Step 2: Capacity Estimation
Step 3: System APIs
Step 4: High-level System Design
Step 5: Data Storage
Step 6: Scalability
