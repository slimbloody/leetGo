last lecture, we talked about state machine replication which is a great way of replicating some data from one node to another. and in order to do state machine replication, we need to ensure that all of the replicas see the same updates in the same order, which we can do with total order broadcast, this now raises the question of how do we implementing total order broadcast?
we saw one way of doing this is to send all of the messages via a particular dedicated node that we call the leader, and this node is going to order all of the messages and make sure that they get delivered in the same order on all of the nodes. unfortunately, if that leader crashes, or it becomes unavailable due to a network problem, or it has a hardware failure or whatever anything goes wrong, then this approach to total order broadcast stops working, now the question is now really how can we deal with the problem of a leader becoming unavailable.


============================================
Fault-tolerant total order broadcast
============================================
Total order broadcast is very useful for state machine replication.

Can implement total order broadcast by sending all messages via a single leader.

Problem: what if leader crashes/ becomes unavailable?
    1. Manual failover:
        a human operator chooses a new leader, and reconfigures each node to use new leader
        Used in many databases! Fine for planned maintenance.


a human operator who gets notified if the leader fails, and this human is then going to choose a new node as the new leader, and it's really going to reconfigure the system, so change all of the followers to accepting and this new node as their new leader, telling this new node that now has to be the leader and act in this capacity to implement total order broadcast, and this works fine if you know in advance if the leader is going to go down, which could happen, for example, if the leader is going down due to planned maintenance, so if you know advance in advance that you want to reboot the leader tonight in order to install some software updates, then you just move the leader role to a different node before you install the software updates, and then you can take it down in peace and quite and no problems at all.
--------------------------------------------------------
        Unplanned outage? Humans are slow, may take a long time until system recovers.

Unfortunately, this doesn't really help you in the case where the leader crashes unexpectedly, or if the leader suddenly develops a hardware fault, and suddenly just stop working, and you know computers do that sometimes they do sometimes just stop working. in that case, it'll probably stop working at the most inconvenient time, so like three int the morning.

can we do this leader transition automatically? this transition of to a new leader is exactly what consensus algorithms are about


====================================================
Consensus and total order broadcast
====================================================
Traditional formulation of consensus: several nodes want to come to agreement about a single value

In context of total order broadcast: this value is the next message to deliver
Once one node decides on a certain message order, all nodes will decide the same order
Consensus and total order broadcast are formally equivalent

Consensus and total order broadcast are two different problems, but they're actually quite closely related as I'll explain now, so the traditional way in which consensus is formulated in distributed systems is that you've got multiple nodes, each node may propose a value and you want all of the nodes to decide on the same value.(by some kind of process, one of those proposals is going to get picked) we want the nodes to agree on one of the values that was proposed. you can think of this as being equivalent to total order broadcast, because in total order broadcast what happens if we want all of the nodes to deliver the same messages in the same order. and so this agreement that the nodes need to come to, is the agreement on what is the next message to deliver in this total order. and so you can keep doing consensus once for each message that needs to be delivered, and the consensus will guarantee that all of the nodes will make the same decision. and so at some point a node decides that on a certain value which means in total order broadcast terms, it delivers that message. and consensus guarantees that once the value has been decided, it's not going to change its mind about it, and so for total-order broadcast, this means now once a message has been delivered, it has been delivered at a certain point in this total order.
for this reason, the consensus problem and total-order broadcast are formally equivalent to each other, which means that if you have an algorithm for one, then you can convert it into an algorithm for the other and vice versa.

----------------------------------------------------
Common consensus algorithms:
    Paxos: single-value consensus
    Multi-Paxos: generalisation to total order broadcast
    Raft, Viewstamped Replication, Zab: total order broadcast by default(zookeeper atomic broadcast zab)

what paxos does actually is only consensus on a single value, but there's an extension to paxos called multi-paxos, which actually provides total order broadcast, so that provides agreement on the sequence of values, i.e.: a sequence of messages to be delivered,



===========================================
Consensus system models
===========================================
Paxos, Raft, etc. assume a partially synchronous, crash-recovery system model.

Why not asynchronous?
    FLP result (Fischer, Lynch, Paterson):
        There is no deterministic consensus algorithm that is guaranteed to terminate in an asynchronous crash-stop system model.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
when we were talking about node behavior for example, we can choose between do we want crash stop or crash recovery or byzantine in which place nodes can behave arbitrarily maliciously. in terms of network do we want to assume fair loss for example. for synchrony timing, are we going to assume an asynchronous system or partially synchronous system or a synchronous system.

all the consensus algorithms do is they choose a partially synchronous crash recovery system model.
you might wonder why particular these choices, so in particular the question of synchrony is an important one, because we've said that a fully synchronous model is unrealistic, because in real systems, you do get network delays and you get various delays that happen at various points, and we can't rely on any upper bound of message latency when sending over the network. so the best we can hope for really is partially synchronous, where most of the time the network is well behaved, but occasionally it has periods where messages are delayed for a long time, or nodes pause their execution for a long time.
ideally we would want consensus to even work in an asynchronous system where we make no timing assumptions at all, but it turns out that this is actually impossible, so there is an impossibility proof which is called the FLP result, which proves that it is not possible to implement a consensus algorithm in an asynchronous system, in such a way that this algorithm will always terminate.
so if you have an asynchronous system and even if you only allow crash stop failures, so even not any of the more complex failures then there will always be some executions of the consensus algorithm in which the algorithm doesn't terminate.
