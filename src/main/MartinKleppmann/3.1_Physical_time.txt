time, clocks, and ordering of events

Distributed systems often need to measure time, e.g.: .
    Schedulers, timeouts, failure detectors, retry timers
    Performance measurements, statistics, profiling
    Log files & databases: record when an event occurred
    Data with time-limited validity (e.g. cache entries )
