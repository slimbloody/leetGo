any computing device that is involved in the system we call a node

We use a simple abstraction of communication:
one node can send a message to another node


Latency and bandwidth
Latency: time until message arrives
depending on how congested the network is
In the same building/ datacenter: ~ 1 ms
One continent to another: ~ 100 ms

Bandwidth: data volume per unit time
3G cellular data: ~ 1 Mbit/s
Home broadband: ~ 10 Mbit/s


wireshark:

networks have this maximum size of packet
