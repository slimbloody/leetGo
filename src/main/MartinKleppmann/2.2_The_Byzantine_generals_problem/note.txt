1. we assume the messengers are reliable
2. some of the general are not loyal, being malicious

for points of view of general3, it's impossible to tell the difference between these two scenarios


Byzantine General Problem:
1. Up to f generals might behave maliciously
2. Honest generals don't know who the malicious ones are
3. The malicious generals may collude
4. Nevertheless, honest generals must agree on plan

honest generals don't know who the malicious generals are, but we going to assume some maximum number of generals being malicious
f generals out of n generals in total

honest generals don't know who the malicious generals are,
but malicious generals may know who the other militias generals are, so they might actually work together in some coordinate fashion to try to deceive and trick the honest generals.

and nevertheless our requirement is that the honest generals agree on a plan
so we can't get malicious generals to agree on any part of the plan, because we assuming that they might misbehave in arbitrary ways


============
todo: 证明这个数值
Theorem: need 3f + 1 generals in total to tolerate f malicious generals (i.e. < -1/3 be malicious)
Cryptography (digital signatures) helps - but problem remains hard
============
a digital signature which is a form of message in which it can be proved that a certain party sent a certain message
in this case, it allows general 2 to prove what a command general 1 sent to general 2, and prove that to general 3 in a way that general 3 would be convinced that general 2 really is honest
